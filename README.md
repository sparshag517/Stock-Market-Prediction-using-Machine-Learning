# Stock-Market-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This program utilizes various Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Keras to perform stock price prediction using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. It fetches historical stock data, preprocesses it, trains an LSTM model, and makes predictions on future stock prices. The code also includes steps for data visualization and scaling.
